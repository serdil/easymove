A request has 2 parts.

1) path
2) tar file

PATH

At the very beginning of the request is an integral number indicating the
length of the path, followed by a whitespace character and target path. After
the path there is a whitespace character, and then starts the content of the
tar file.


TAR FILE

An easymove client first packages the files it would like to send into a
tarball and sends the tarball together with the target path to an easymove
server. The easymove server unpacks the tarball into the specified path.
